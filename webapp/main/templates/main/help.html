	  <h4>What happens after 30 days is up and the total price is not reached?</h4>
	  <p>If only a relatively small amount is remaining, you can make a contribution
	  of your own.<br>
	  If the full amount is not reached within 30 days, all contributors will have
	  their payments refunded at no additional expense.
	  </p>

	  <h4>Can I contribute to my own Wish List?</h4>
	  <p>Yes you certainly can. Perhaps your friends have contributed some but not
	  all, you can contribute the remainder.</p>
